- implementing the entire applied machine learning workflow from start to finish 
  and focus on how they work together.

- This is a top-down approach that will first show  exactly where each piece fits
  into the big picture.

- This is to develop a high-level intuition of the entire process needed to build 
  an effective model using machine learning. 

- to practice using the entire suite of machine learning tools at your disposal.


## Exploratory Analysis
### Exercise 1.1 - Back to Basics
- Checking the Head and Tails of the dataset.

### Exercise 1.2 - Distributions
- using Histograms


### Exercise 1.3 - Segmentation
- Segmenting dataframes
### Exercise 1.5 - Correlation Analysis 
- using heatmap
  1. Change the background to white. This way, 0 correlation will show as white
  2. Annotate the cell with their correlations values
  3. Mask the top triangle (less visual clutter)
  4. Drop the legend (colorbar on the side)
